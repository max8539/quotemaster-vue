# quotemaster-vue
A simple web app for sharing quotes!

This web app makes use of the following backend API: [mini-apis](https://github.com/max8539/mini-apis).

quotemaster-vue and its sister web app quotemaster-react \(coming soon\) were created as a way for me to start learning about frontend web development frameworks. 

quotemaster-vue was created with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org), and built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
