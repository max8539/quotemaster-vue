# quotemaster-vue
A simple web app for sharing quotes!

This web app requires a connection to an instance of [mini-apis](https://github.com/max8539/mini-apis).

quotemaster-vue and its sister web app quotemaster-react \(coming soon\) were created as a way for me to start learning about frontend web development frameworks. 

quotemaster-vue was created with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org), and built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## How to run
1. Start an instance of [mini-apis](https://github.com/max8539/mini-apis) by following the instructions on its repository, or have a link to an existing instance which you have permission to use.
2. Open `src/config.js` and change the following constants:
    - `HOST` should be the URL of this web app when it is running. This can be either a localhost (if using local preview) or a public web address (if deploying to the web).
    - `API-HOST` should be the URL of your running instance of mini-apis. 
3. Run `npm run build` to build your code, then either run `npm run preview` to run a local preview, or deploy the built code to a web server.
